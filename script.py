# 2. Roller coasters are thrilling amusement park rides designed to make you squeal and scream! They take you up high,
# drop you to the ground quickly, and sometimes even spin you upside down before returning to a stop. Today you will be
# taking control back from the roller coasters and visualizing data covering international roller coaster rankings and
# roller coaster statistics.
#
# Roller coasters are often split into two main categories based on their construction material: wood or steel. Rankings
# for the best wood and steel roller coasters from the 2013 to 2018 Golden Ticket Awards are provided in
# 'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Wood.csv' and 'Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Steel.csv', respectively. Load each csv into
# a DataFrame and inspect it to gain familiarity with the data.

# load rankings data here:

wood_data = pd.read_csv('Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Wood.csv')
steel_data = pd.read_csv('Golden_Ticket_Award_Winners_Steel.csv')
print(wood_data.head(), steel_data.head())


# 3. Write a function that will plot the ranking of a given roller coaster over time as a line. Your function should
# take a roller coasterâ€™s name and a ranking DataFrame as arguments. Make sure to include informative labels that
# describe your visualization.
#
# Call your function with "El Toro" as the roller coaster name and the wood ranking DataFrame. What issue do you notice?
# Update your function with an additional argument to alleviate the problem, and retest your function.

# write function to plot rankings over time for 1 roller coaster here:

# write function to plot rankings over time for 2 roller coasters here:

# load roller coaster data here:



# write function to plot histogram of column values here:
